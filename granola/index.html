    <h2>Homemade Granola</h2>
    <h4>paleo and vegan, I think it tastes better than the oats.</h4>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 c coconut flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 c pumpkin seed (not from China)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon (grind fresh cinnamon stick)</li>
        <li>1/4 or more cup sunflower seed </li>
        <li>1/4 or a little more c quinoa (rinse with water)</li>
        <li>3 tsp coconut oil </li>
        <li>1/4 cup 100% real maple syrup</li>
        <li>4 big pinchs salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Instructions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 325 degree F.</li>
        <li> In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients (coconut flakes, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, sunflower seed, quinoa).</li>
        <li> In a small saucepan, heat coconut oil and maple syrup over medium-low heat just until coconut becomes liquid.</li>
        <li> Add liquid mix to dry mix, til it's all evenly covered.</li>
        <li> Line two baking sheets. Spread granola mix on thin thin layer. Make sure it's all very evenly flat.</li> 
        <li> Place in oven for 20 minutes, gently stir and check ends half way through.</li>
        <li> As you bake at your granola, make sure it gets to a toasted, golden brown (and will smell amazingly aromatic!). Check your granola often so it does not burn.</li>
        <li> Take out, stir a little more, move the ends in the middle and the middle toward the end to cook evenly. Rotate sheets 180 so it's cooked as evenly as possible.</li>
        <li> Bake another 8 minutes.</li>
        <li> Take out, let sit to cool. Granola will get crispy when it cools down.</li>
        <li> Store in airtight container.</li>

    </ol>
